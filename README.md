- **API consumption**. The app movideDb Api (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started).
  
- **MVVM architecture**. The app is based on modern Android components and MVVM architecture.
- **Modularization**. Using the app and core module to have a better separation of each dependency and sending an easy-to-update code.
- **Clean Architecture**. It's development follows clean architecture practices, such as separation of core, domain, data and presentation layers.
  
- **ViewModel and LiveData**. It exposes state to the UI and encapsulates the corresponding business logic. The main advantage of the ViewModel is that it caches state and retains this information even after configuration changes.
- **Coroutines**. Extensive use of coroutines for remote data access and other operations.
- **Paging3**. Required to list paginated items coming from the api.
- **Dependency injection with Koin**.
- **Retrofit**. Used to communicate with the API.
- **Glide**. Used to format api images.
  
- **CircleImage**. This dependency helps when using images where they are rounded to be used as a profile photo, for example.
- **Binding**. Binding plays a fundamental role in a project, especially in software development contexts. It refers to the way in which parts interact and communicate within a system.
- **Detekt**. Ensuring clean and easy-to-understand code
- **Flexible UseCase class**. Employ inheritance to create a flexible UseCase<Param, Source> class.
- **ShimmerFacebook**. handling loading state and error.
